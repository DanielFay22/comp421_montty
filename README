Note on ReadTerminal:
My implementation for ReadTerminal essentially holds the reading threads
until a line is read, then it begins reading from the input buffer. It
continues to read until either the last entered \n is reached or the end of
the buffer is reached. At this point if there is a thread waiting it begins
to read characters from the buffer. Once it is done reading, if there are
still newline characters in the buffer it signals any other waiting threads
so that another can continue reading.
